# Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator
This is a Python program that utilizes the renowned Harris-Benedict formula revised by Mifflin and St Jeor (1990) to calculate the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). The Harris-Benedict formula is a widely recognized and utilized equation for estimating the basic caloric needs of the human body.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/beckerfelipee/Basal-Metabolic-Rate-Calculator.git
 ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

 ```bash
cd Basal-Metabolic-Rate-Calculator
 ```

4. Run the program

```bash
python main.py
 ```
### Or

# Harris-Benedict Formula
This program uses the revised Harris–Benedict formula developed by [Mifflin and St Jeor in 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916523166986?via%3Dihub) to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) – the amount of calories the body burns daily at rest. Originally formulated by [Harris and Benedict in 1918](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.4.12.370), the 1990 revision adjusts parameters to provide more accurate estimates of resting energy expenditure, taking into account factors such as age, weight, height, and biological sex.

The calculations can be derived from the following formulas:

It should be taken into consideration that, while the formula provides an estimate, it does not account for individual variations in metabolism and body composition. Other factors, such as lifestyle and levels of physical activity, also influence energy needs. Therefore, while the formula is useful as an initial reference, it is important to consider other elements when adjusting calorie recommendations to meet individual needs.
