# Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator
This is a Python program that utilizes the renowned Harris-Benedict formula to calculate the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). The Harris-Benedict formula is a widely recognized and utilized equation for estimating the basic caloric needs of the human body.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/beckerfelipee/Basal-Metabolic-Rate-Calculator.git
 ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

 ```bash
cd Basal-Metabolic-Rate-Calculator
 ```

4. Run the program

```bash
python main.py
 ```
# Harris-Benedict Formula
The Harris-Benedict formula for basal metabolic rate is an estimate of the amount of energy the body requires at rest, taking into account factors such as weight, height, age, and biological sex.

The calculations can be derived from the following formulas:

However, it is an estimation and does not consider individual variations in metabolism and body composition. Other factors, such as lifestyle and levels of physical activity, also influence energy needs. Therefore, while the formula is useful as an initial reference, it is important to consider other elements when adjusting calorie recommendations to meet individual needs.
